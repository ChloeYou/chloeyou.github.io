### About Me
Hello! I am a second year biostatistics Master's student at [the University of
British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/), supervised by [Prof. 
Gabriela V. Cohen Freue](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/gabriela-v-cohen-freue). 
My current research focuses on developing statistical learning methods that can be applied to clinical and 
high-dimensional data. 

In my spare time, I enjoy snowboarding, yoga, and bothering my houseplants. 

### Work

During the summer of 2022, I had the privilege of working as a Statistical Software Developer alongside [Prof Daniel J. McDonald](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/daniel-j-mcdonald) and the [DELPHI](https://delphi.cmu.edu/) team. Together, we built an [R package](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epipredict/index.html) for epidemiological predictive modeling (fingers crossed that I wrote enough unit tests to cover all edge cases!)

Before pursuing my Master's degree, I had the opportunity to work as a Business Analyst at Electronic Arts. During my time there, I mainly worked on [Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville](https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-battle-for-neighborville) :sunflower:
and [Skate 4](https://www.ea.com/games/skate).

As a Business Analyst, my primary responsibility was to gather and analyze data related to the games' performance and make recommendations to improve the player experience. This involved working closely with various teams within the company, including developers, designers, and project managers, to ensure that we were meeting our goals and delivering the best possible gaming experience to our players. 

Specifically, on Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville, I was responsible for tracking and analyzing player engagement and behavior within the game. This allowed us to identify areas for improvement and make adjustments to the game's features and design to increase engagement and retention. In addition to this, I also built multiple predictive models that were embedded into the game for A/B tests. These models allowed us to predict the impact of certain game changes on engagement and retention, which was crucial for making informed design decisions.

Working on Skate 4 was an exciting challenge as it allowed me to collaborate with various teams, including UI/UX designers, to ensure that the game was both visually appealing and intuitive for users to navigate. In addition, I automated reporting for weekly playtests and analyzed larger-scale community playtests to gather feedback on the game's mechanics and overall experience, which helped us to refine the game's design and make it more enjoyable for players.
