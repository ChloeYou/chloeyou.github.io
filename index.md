### About Me
Hello! I am a second year biostatistics Master's student at [the University of
British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/), supervised by [Prof. 
Gabriela V. Cohen Freue](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/gabriela-v-cohen-freue). 
My current interests are in statistical learning methods applied to public health
and genomics. 

In my spare time, I enjoy snowboarding, playing volleyball, and yoga. 
### Work
I worked as a statistical software developer in Summer 2022 with 
[Prof Daniel J. McDonald](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/daniel-j-mcdonald) and 
[DELPHI](https://delphi.cmu.edu/) to build an 
[R package](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epipredict/index.html) for epidemiological 
predictive modeling. 

Prior to that, I was working as a business analyst at Electronic Arts before coming back
for my Master's. I mainly worked on
[Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville](https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-battle-for-neighborville) :sunflower:
and [Skate 4](https://twitter.com/skateea).

### Education

* B.Sc. in Statistics, University of British Columbia, 2015-2019
